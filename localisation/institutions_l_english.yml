 desc_writing:0 "As man and mer societies emerged, the development of writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as exchanging information, maintaining financial accounts, codifying laws and recording history. In the Merethic Era, the complexity of trade and administration in the Nirn outgrew people' memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form. Even millenia after its invention writing remains one of the most important requirements for the emergence civilized societies and great technological and intellectual achievements would be impossile without it."
 desc_legalism:0 "Legalism is a classical school of philosophy that groups thinkers crucial to laying the 'intellectual and ideological foundations of the traditional bureaucratic empire'. Often compared with modern social sciences, they have been regarded as having three tendencies: the enforcement of law, the manipulation of statecraft, and the exercise of power, articulating political technique that would ultimately form guiding principles for the Emperors. Highly effective in the short run, their dismissiveness of traditional culture, morality and anti-ministerial approach earned them enmity, causing them to be often overlaid with traditional ideology and customs."
 desc_ancient_imperialism:0 "Imperialism is a policy that means extending a country's power through military and diplomacy. Its name originates from the word imperium, which means to rule over large territories. Generally this means a multi-ethnic or multinational state with political and military dominion of populations who are culturally and ethnically distinct from the ruling imperial ethnic group and its culture. The Altmers were the first nation to invent and embody the concept of empire in their two mandates: to wage war and to make and execute laws."
 desc_caste_system:0 "Caste is a form of social stratification characterized by endogamy, hereditary transmission of a lifestyle which often includes an occupation, ritual status in a hierarchy, and customary social interaction and exclusion based on cultural notions of purity and pollution. Its paradigmatic ethnographic example is the division of society into rigid social groups, with roots in ancient history and persisting until today. Sometimes, sociologists and anthropologists study the caste-like social divisions existing in various countries by using the Tang Mo caste system as an analogical basis for research."
 desc_organized_religion:0 "Organized religion, also known as institutional religion, is religion as a social institution, in which belief systems and rituals are systematically arranged and formally established. Organized religion is typically characterized by an official doctrine or dogma, a hierarchical or bureaucratic leadership structure, and a codification of rules and practices. Due to their structured, standardized, and so easily proliferated form, organized religions comprise many of the world's major religious groups."
 desc_serfdom:0 "Serfdom is a condition of bondage, which developed primarily during the First Era in the Nirn. Serfs who occupied a plot of land were required to work for the lord of the manor who owned that land, and in return were entitled to protection, justice and the right to exploit certain fields within the manor to maintain their own subsistence. Serfs were often required not only to work on the lord's fields, but also his mines, forests and roads. The manor formed the basic unit of feudal society, and the lord of the manor and his serfs were bound legally, economically, and socially. Serfs formed the lowest social class of feudal society."
 desc_manorialism:0 "Manorialism was the organizing principle of rural economy. It was widely practiced in the Nirn, and was slowly replaced by the advent of a money-based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract. Manorialism was characterised by the vesting of legal and economic power in a Lord of the Manor, supported economically from his own direct landholding in a manor, and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under the jurisdiction of himself and his manorial court. These obligations could be payable in several ways, in labor, in kind, or, on rare occasions, in coin."
 desc_early_feudalism:0 "The classic version of feudalism describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs. A lord was in broad terms a noble who held land, a vassal was a person who was granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land was known as a fief. In exchange for the use of the fief and the protection of the lord, the vassal would provide some sort of service to the lord. There were many varieties of feudal land tenure, consisting of military and non-military service. The obligations and corresponding rights between lord and vassal concerning the fief form the basis of the feudal relationship."
 desc_crop_rotation:0 "Agriculturalists have long recognized that suitable rotations - such as planting spring crops for livestock in place of grains for human consumption - make it possible to restore or to maintain a productive soil. Farmers already practised crop rotation in the Nirn without understanding the chemistry, alternately planting legumes and cereals. One section was planted in the autumn with rye or winter wheat, followed by spring oats or barley; the second section grew crops such as peas, lentils, or beans; and the third field was left fallow."
 desc_civil_service:0 "The origin of the modern meritocratic civil service can be traced back to Imperial examination. The Imperial exam based on merit was designed to select the best administrative officials for the state's bureaucracy. This system had a huge influence on both society and culture in the Empire and was directly responsible for the creation of a class of scholar-bureaucrats irrespective of their family pedigree. In theory, the civil service system provided one of the major outlets for social mobility in medieval societies, although in practice, due to the time-consuming nature of the study, the examination was generally only taken by sons of the elite."
 desc_manuscripts:0 "Manuscript culture uses manuscripts to store and disseminate information; it generally preceded the age of printing. In early manuscript culture, monks copied manuscripts by hand. They copied not just religious works, but a variety of texts including some on astronomy, herbals, and bestiaries. Manuscript culture deals with the transition of the manuscript from the monasteries to the market in the cities, and the rise of universities. Manuscript culture in the cities created jobs built around the making and trade of manuscripts, and typically was regulated by universities."
 desc_scholasticism:0 "Scholasticism is a method of critical thought which dominated teaching by the academics of universities, and a program of employing that method in articulating and defending dogma in an increasingly pluralistic context. It originated as an outgrowth of and a departure from monastic schools at the earliest universities among the Nirn."
 desc_guilds:0 "Guilds are associations of artisans or merchants who control the practice of their craft in a particular town. The earliest types of guild were formed as confraternities of tradesmen. They were organized in a manner something between a professional association, trade union, a cartel, and a secret society. They often depended on grants of letters patent by a monarch or other authority to enforce the flow of trade to their self-employed members, and to retain ownership of tools and the supply of materials. A lasting legacy of traditional guilds are the guildhalls constructed and used as meeting places. An important result of the guild framework was the emergence of universities in the Nirn."
 desc_medicine:0 "The major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection, of what may be called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly. Physicians like Vesalius improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past. The main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were Materia Medica and Pharmacopoeia."
 desc_feudalism:0 "Over time most societies develop a need for a common structure with stronger and more permanent institutions of government. For similar reasons permanent government and societal systems have formed all over the world, some of which have roots that go far further back than Feudalism itself.\nUnlike the other Institutions 'Feudalism' covers a wide range of different systems and exists from the start in all parts of the world where a strong tradition of Urbanism, Institutionalized Government and Social Stratification has reached a critical point. The institution can spread from contact with any of these cultures, or in some cases begin to grow on its own in a society that fulfills certain criteria."
 desc_renaissance:0 "The wealthy and powerful in the cities have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the old societies of their forefathers. As a cultural movement the Renaissance already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy and music. Humanist scholars are also analyzing the society in which they live, comparing it to the ideals of the Classical philosophers. Renaissance Humanism has grown into a more mature movement, ready to permeate all aspects of society. A new ideal for rulers as well as those who are ruled is spreading as quickly as the early Printers can distribute copies of these new ideas. A true Renaissance Humanist is an expert on everything from Politics and Philosophy to art, textual analysis, music and architecture. The Renaissance is now ready to reshape the world to better fit its classical ideals."
 desc_new_world_i:0 "The discovery of the Akavir has heralded a new era not only for the colonizers and the colonized, it has led to a spread of materials and techniques as well as a realization of the vast size of the globe. As animals, crop types, silver and diseases spread across the Pandomaic Ocean the first steps have been taken towards a truly global economy and as foreign lands and people are mapped and documented ideas as well as religious and philosophical debate has become more and more colored by what we have found in overseas societies."
 desc_printing_press:0 "The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information and in many ways the early modern society as a whole. Pioneered by Renaissance men, the new art helped fuel the Renaissance by making the translated classics more widely available. With Print Shops growing evermore commonplace rulers have found it hard to contain the new technique as the comparatively easy means of production means censorship can be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page."
 desc_global_trade:0 "Goods have been moved across continents since the Merethic Era. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the discovery of the Akavir, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web."
 desc_manufactories:0 "While a number of technical innovations has increased the output of production for some products such as iron or cloth to an extent the biggest improvement in the field of production has come in the form of new forms of organization. By creating Manufactories, often outside the city limits, merchant capitalists can both bypass the ancient guild laws that prevent mass production in principle as well as pioneer ways to increase production through organizing and specialization of labor in one place. The forerunners of the later Industrialization are able to increase output by facilitating access to raw materials and mass organization of labor rather than by expensive new machinery. This is in itself a huge change over the often heavily regulated methods of old, however, and together with later technical advances this new mode of production will come to revolutionize society."
 desc_enlightenment:0 "The last century has seen Rationalism and Empiricism gaining an ever increasing popularity among the great minds of the age. In letters, publications or coffee houses kings, scientists, philosophers and litterateurs are discussing the merits of tolerance, the scientific method and the spreading of enlightenment ideals to all humanity. From universities or courts of enlightened monarchs expeditions are being sent to measure, catalogue, weigh and map the world so that we can better understand the laws that govern the things around us. Others discuss the laws that govern society and try to reach an understanding of the Rights of Men.\nGreat projects such as the colossal undertaking of creating a complete encyclopedia of all knowledge or a complete index of all plants, animals and fungi in the world are being pursued for the greater good of humanity. The Light of Reason has been lit and many will not rest until it has been brought to all corners of the earth."
 desc_imperialism:0 "Imperialism is a policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means. Imperialism is particularly focused on the control that one group, often a state power, has on another group of people. This is often through various forms of 'othering' based on racial, religious, or cultural stereotypes. Imperialism has been subject to moral or immoral censure by its critics, but it has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas into colonial territories."
 desc_industrialization:0 "The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, improved efficiency of water power, the increasing use of steam power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system. Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods."
 desc_nationalism_institution:0 "Nationalism is a shared group feeling in the significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic region seeking independence for its culture or ethnicity that holds that group together. This can be expressed as a belief or political ideology that involves an individual identifying with or becoming attached to one's nation. National symbols, anthems, myths, flags and narratives were assiduously constructed and adopted. The political development of nationalism and the push for popular sovereignty culminated with the national revolutions of Tamriel. Since that time, nationalism has become one of the most significant political and social forces in history."
 desc_electrification:0 "Electrification is the build out of the electrical generating and distribution systems. Although early electricity was very expensive, it was far cheaper and more convenient than oil, steam power or manual labor making the period of electrification of factories and households one of high productivity and economic growth."
