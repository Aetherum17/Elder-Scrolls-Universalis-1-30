 consolidation_of_the_estates_desc:0 "The sovereign nations of Tamriel are too often prone to falling into the trappings of tradition.

 albertine_and_ernestine_desc:0 "The power of the Tribunal has waned over the centuries, and Morrowind's economic and cultural ties to the Empire are continually growing stronger. We should try getting ahead of the curve by opening our arms to further imperial influences."
 meissner_porcelain:0 "The Mouse"
 meissner_porcelain_desc:0 "We are not one of the five traditional Great Houses of Morrowind. As such, we must carry ourselves with all the caution of a minor player on the political stage. Never aggressive, never defensive. We must be like the wildgrass of Ascadian-- ever blowing with the wind."

 sax_principal_line:0 "Tax Reform"
 sax_principal_line_desc:0 "The Dunmer system of tax collection and revenue acquisition is far too outdated. Not only does the Tribunal drain a large portion of our house's tax income, but countless loopholes utilized by Hlaalu merchants and foreign moneymen have also left our balance sheets in a poor state. We must look to revise regional tax law-- with the help of the Empire of course."
 the_saxon_circle:0 "Usurp Greatness"
 the_saxon_circle_desc:0 "With the Hlaalu disgraced, Vivec destroyed in the north, and Redoran ooccupied with Argonian incursions to the south, our path to greater influence is open. The name, Sadras, may soon become synonymous with great."

 people_of_the_book:0 "Acquire Weak Bloodlines"
 people_of_the_book_desc:0 "While the gift of pure-blooded vampirism is far too precious a gift to freely dole out, ordinary vampirism is not. By subjugating lesser vampire clans, we can spread newer, less potent strains of vampirism without damaging the exclusivity of our own."
 recover_al_andalus:0 "Pinnacle of Vampirism"

 beacon_of_learning_desc:0 "The kingdom once ruled by the Volkihar line is long defunct, but the fact of the matter remains: Volkihar blood is blood of royalty."
 strait_of_gibraltar:0 "Integrated Battalions"
 strait_of_gibraltar_desc:0 "Vampirism is a powerful gift, but cannot be widely used due to constraints brought upon by our limited supply of blood thralls. As an army of vampires is logistically unfeasible, we will instead implement them as officers and small, elite regiments."
 alhambra:0 "Depopulate Countrysides"
 alhambra_desc:0 "Morality. A foolish constraint-- one that the followers of the Lord of Domination needn't heed. By allowing our armies to loot, pillage, and feed as they please, they will be able to retain their cohesion, even in the midst of hostile territory."
 moors:0 "Drilled by Fear"
 moors_desc:0 "A soldier once argued to Lord Harkon about the difference between respect and fear and the merits of the former. The soldier's torso is no longer with us, but his head remains in the halls of Castle Volkihar. It is serves as a reminder to his progeny: Obedience is all."

 greek_maritime_heritage_desc:0 "While our citizens are pure of blood, our kingdom is home to myriad numbers of enslaved younger races. If we are to prosper, we must deny these other mer from positions of power. They are quick to rely on the trappings of emotion and are not yet ready for rule."

 greek_enlightenment_desc:0 "Whisperings among our slaves have led us to believe an uprising is on its way. Our soldiers must be drilled in order to repel both internal strife and external attacks by those who seek to capitalize on our weakness."

 ASA_ideas_bonus:0 "Hlaalu Ambition"
 asa_hidden_diplomacy:0 "Utilize Connections"
 asa_hidden_diplomacy_desc:0 "In the business of moneymaking, conflict is inevitable. Sometimes we're forced to sieze a few buildings, annex one or two regions, maybe purge a city. At the end of the day, people understand that such grievances are necessary towards maintaining a trade empire. And if they don't at first, then we'll pay them until they do. And if they still don't then... Well, take three more ideas and find out."
 asa_echizen_paper:0 "Corporate Espionage"
 asa_echizen_paper_desc:0 "For all our murderous needs, we Hlaalu rely on the Morag Tong. That is, of course, unless the Dark Brotherhood's rates are cheaper... For legal reasons, that last sentence was a joke."
 asa_ichijodani_city:0 "Renovate Narsis"
 asa_ichijodani_city_desc:0 "Narsis has become old, antiquated, characterized by cracked stone and worn buildings. This will not do; the Hlaalu seat of power must be a beacon of prosperity in Morrowind!"
 asa_teach_of_asakura_soteki:0 "Mercantile Tradition"
 asa_teach_of_asakura_soteki_desc:0 "Gold is, without a doubt, the closest Nirn has to the physical embodiment of power. No other metal, worldly or not, has the quite the same physiological effect: the boiling of blood, the clogging of sweaty pores. Gold is truly great, and we Hlaalu understand it like no other."
 asa_seventeen_clan_code:0 "Business Saavy"
 asa_seventeen_clan_code_desc:0 "If a Telvanni's blade is his magic, a Dres' blade his whip, and a Redoran's blade his blade, then a Hlaalu's blade is his business saavy. Indeed, members born into our house just seem to have a penchant for making fistfuls of gold; we can't help it."
 asa_control_of_buddhist_sects:0 "Great House Rivalry"
 asa_control_of_buddhist_sects_desc:0 "Telvanni boasts powerful mages, and Redoran... Well, Redoran is frankly a terror on the battlefield. But we needn't fight them face-to-face. In fact, we needn't fight them at all when we can hire some other idiots to fight and die in our stead."
 asa_legacy_of_emperor_keitai:0 "Challenge Redoran"
 asa_legacy_of_emperor_keitai_desc:0 "Our house does not possess comparable military prowesses to the other Great Houses. Not even close. However, we may be able to close the gap by utlizing our financial resources. Our foreign contacts often speak of elite mercenaries such as the Warclaws from Elsweyr or certain ex-legion enclaves."

 deccani_muslim_ideas_bonus:0 "Nedic Ambition"
 dec_legacy_of_bahmanis:0 "Preservation of Dignity"
 dec_legacy_of_bahmanis_desc:0 "Our people are no strangers to persecution. In Ayleid lands, for example, Nedes are treated as little more than livestock. In these times of such grave injustice, we must band together and look to our own for deliverance."
 dec_deccani_identity:0 "Reclaim Nedic Legacy"
 dec_deccani_identity_desc:0 "We were once the undisputed masters of Tamriel. Once. Our ancestral homelands have long been stolen away by knife-eared slavers and northern barbarians, usurpers who rule in the name of false, foreign gods. If we are to reclaim our legacy, we must push these invaders back where they belong-- the coldest depths of the sea."
 dec_brahmin_administrators:0 "Home"
 dec_brahmin_administrators_desc:0 "Listen. Do you hear it? The claws of a Duneripper treading sand, the howling of wolves carried on by a forlorn wind, and the gentle southbound breeze of a most brilliant emerald sea. We hear it all. We hear it, because this land is tied to us through blood and spirit. All of Tamriel belongs to us." 
 dec_habshis:0 "Look to the Stars"
 dec_habshis_desc:0 "The culture and beliefs of our people have long been tied to the stars. Each and every light in the night sky holds meaning to us, every constellation, a profound answer. In the age of strife to come, the stars will continue to guide us. They must."
 dec_bargi_giri:0 "Deathland Tradition"
 dec_bargi_giri_desc:0 "Few people can survive in the Deathlands of Hammerfell. Even fewer can thrive. We belong to the latter group, having prospered in the harshest deserts and most arid of climates in Hammerfell for countless generations. Excelling in such conditions has empowered our armies, conditioning our soldiers to tolerate even the most strenuous of marches."
 dec_marathi_cultivators:0 "Far and Wide"
 dec_marathi_cultivators_desc:0 "While remaining vestiges of Nedic governance have been isolated in eastern Cyrodil, our cultural influence is still prevalent throughout Tamriel. As such, our surviving domains hold considerable influence in foreign dealings."
 dec_marathi_habshi_state:0 "Against the Tide"
 dec_marathi_habshi_state_desc:0 "Our combined history is one of endless invasion and subjugation. For every foreign conqueror we put to the sword, another sprouts in his place. So be it. Let them crash against our shore, let them try and erode the stone of our will. We ask these foolish invaders only one thing: What will happen to the sea when the land grows weary of its wailing?"

 nep_kashmiri_traders_desc:0 "Countless Nords have emigrated from Skyrim, travelling across Tamriel to make names for themselves as soldiers of fortune. Our domain has ties to many of these ambitious mercenaries; perhaps we can use these relations to our advantage?"
 nep_new_festivals:0 "Legacy of the Dragon War"
 nep_new_festivals_desc:0 "Mortal. Finite. Temporary."
 nep_kavindra:0 "Abolish Old Jarldoms"
 nep_kavindra_desc:0 "Our expansion across the northern stretch of Tamriel has left us with a large number of autonomous states. In order to tighten control of these areas, we should look to appoint new counts and jarls, men and women who are loyal to our regime."
 nep_construct_temples:0 "Nordic Bards"
 nep_construct_temples_desc:0 "War is not the only pastime of the Nords. We are also famous lovers of music; countless of our legends have been immortalized in song. These ballads serve as reminders and symbols of Nordic strength."
 nep_seize_mountain_passes:0 "Blood of Atmora"
 nep_seize_mountain_passes_desc:0 "Nords physically tower above all other races on Tamriel, and our innate fighting ability gives our nation an edge against external threats."
 nep_judicial_reforms:0 "Unite Skyrim"
 nep_judicial_reforms_desc:0 "Northern Tamriel lies shattered, disparate. If we were to unite these separate Nordic domains into one, we may be able to claim our rightful place as heirs to Ysgramor."
 nep_end_division_of_domains:0 "Standardized Architecture"
 nep_end_division_of_domains_desc:0 "We laugh at the gold spires and dainty castles of the knife-ears and milkdrinkers to our south. Their architecture focuses on naught but the aesthetic. When we Nords build something, our focus is purely on function."
